\title{Replace multiple patterns found in a character string column of a data frame}
\usage{
FindReplace(
  data,
  Var,
  replaceData,
  from = "from",
  to = "to",
  exact = TRUE,
  vector = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame with the column you would like to replace string
patterns.}

\item{Var}{character string naming the column you would like to replace
string patterns. The column must be of class \code{character} or
\code{factor}.}

\item{replaceData}{a data frame with at least two columns. One contains the
patterns to replace and the other contains their replacement. Note: the
pattern and its replacement must be in the same row.}

\item{from}{character string naming the column with the patterns you would
like to replace.}

\item{to}{character string naming the column with the the pattern
replacements.}

\item{exact}{logical. Indicates whether to only replace exact pattern matches
(\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{vector}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then the replacement is returned as a
single vector. If \code{FALSE} then the whole data frame is returned.}
}
\description{
\code{FindReplace} allows you to find and replace multiple character string
patterns in a data frame's column.

\examples{
# Create original data
ABData <- data.frame(a = c("London, UK", "Oxford, UK", "Berlin, DE",
                    "Hamburg, DE", "Oslo, NO"),
                    b = c(8, 0.1, 3, 2, 1))

# Create replacements data frame
Replaces <- data.frame(from = c("UK", "DE"), to = c("England", "Germany"))

# Replace patterns and return full data frame
ABNewDF <- FindReplace(data = ABData, Var = "a", replaceData = Replaces,
                     from = "from", to = "to", exact = FALSE)

# Replace patterns and return the Var as a vector
ABNewVector <- FindReplace(data = ABData, Var = "a", replaceData = Replaces,
                     from = "from", to = "to", vector = TRUE)
