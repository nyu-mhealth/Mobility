\title{Merges 2 data frames and report/drop/keeps only duplicates.}
\usage{
dMerge(
  data1,
  data2,
  by,
  Var,
  dropDups = TRUE,
  dupsOut = FALSE,
  fromLast = FALSE,
  all = FALSE,
  all.x = all,
  all.y = all,
  sort = TRUE,
  suffixes = c(".x", ".y"),
  incomparables = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{a data frame. The first data frame to merge.}

\item{data2}{a data frame. The second data frame to merge.}

\item{by}{specifications of the columns used for merging.}

\item{Var}{depricated.}

\item{dropDups}{logical. Whether or not to drop duplicated rows based on
\code{Var}. If \code{dropDups = FALSE} then it gives a count of the
duplicated rows.}

\item{dupsOut}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then a data frame only containing
duplicated values is returned and \code{dropDups} is ignored.}

\item{fromLast}{logical indicating if duplication should be considered from
the reverse side. Only relevant if \code{dropDups = TRUE}.}

\item{all}{logical; all = L is shorthand for \code{all.x = L} and
\code{all.y = L}, where \code{L} is either \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}.}

\item{all.x}{logical; if TRUE, then extra rows will be added to the output,
one for each row in x that has no matching row in y. These rows will have
\code{NA}s in those columns that are usually filled with values from y. The
default is # \code{FALSE}, so that only rows with data from both x and y are
included in the output.}

\item{all.y}{logical; analogous to \code{all.x}.}

\item{sort}{logical. Should the result be sorted on the by columns?}

\item{suffixes}{a character vector of length 2 specifying the suffixes to be
used for making unique the names of columns in the result which not used for
merging (appearing in by etc).}

\item{incomparables}{values which cannot be matched. See \code{\link{match}}.}
